## Welcome to my <em>Linear Algebra and Analytic Geommetry</em> Projects repository!
In this MATLAB project repository, you will find materials related to projects completed during my academic journey in Mechanical Engineering. Theses projects focuses solely on the principles and applications of Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry within the context of engineering studies.

The first assignment focused on solving systems of linear equations using decomposition methods like PA = LU, forward and backward substitution techniques, and verifying solutions' accuracy. QR decomposition and orthogonal projections were also utilized, along with the least squares method to find solutions when exact solutions were not feasible. Overall, the assignments aimed to apply various linear algebra concepts and techniques to solve practical problems.

The second assignment involved constructing matrices based on specific data, performing matrix operations such as multiplication and addition, and analyzing their properties. Additionally, determinants, adjoint matrices, inverses, and algebraic complements were calculated for specific matrices.
